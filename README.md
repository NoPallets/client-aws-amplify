## Development

This project was created with the intend to learn more about Hasura, NextJS and Tailwind.
I'm rebuilding the old version of https://www.nopallets.com/, which was created with VueJS and NetlifyCMS.

Some things I'm planning to add to the new version:

- Login system
- Custom Dashboard (Basically it's own CMS)
- Better performance using NextJS Static Site Generation and next/image.

Current live version of this project is running on https://no-pallets-client.vercel.app/.
Still in developemnt phase!

### Setup local dev environment

```shell
git clone git@github.com:NoPallets/client.git
cd frontend

# install dependencies /// make sure you are using Node v14 or smaller
yarn

# Symlink dev environment
ln -hfs .env.example .env.local

# Start the project
yarn dev
```

## Backend

Currently all the backend is in the cloud.

The [Hasura client](https://hasura.io/) and Postgres are hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)
And we are using S3 buckets inside AWS to store the images.

## GraphQl codegen

We are using codegenator to create our Typescript types from our GraphQL schema.

The code is generated straight from our schema in Hasura into `./src/graphql/generated/graphql.tsx`

Just run `yarn graphql:types`

For example, given the following schema:

```graphql
type Author {
  id: Int!
  firstName: String!
  lastName: String!
  posts(findTitle: String): [Post]
}

type Post {
  id: Int!
  title: String!
  author: Author!
}

type Query {
  posts: [Post]
}

schema {
  query: Query
}
```

GraphQL Code Generator can generate the following TypeScript typings:

```typescript
export type Maybe<T> = T | null;

/** All built-in and custom scalars, mapped to their actual values */
export type Scalars = {
  ID: string;
  String: string;
  Boolean: boolean;
  Int: number;
  Float: number;
};

export type Author = {
  __typename?: "Author";
  id: Scalars["Int"];
  firstName: Scalars["String"];
  lastName: Scalars["String"];
  posts?: Maybe<Array<Maybe<Post>>>;
};

export type AuthorPostsArgs = {
  findTitle?: Maybe<Scalars["String"]>;
};

export type Post = {
  __typename?: "Post";
  id: Scalars["Int"];
  title: Scalars["String"];
  author: Author;
};

export type Query = {
  __typename?: "Query";
  posts?: Maybe<Array<Maybe<Post>>>;
};
```
